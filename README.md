🚀 Planned Improvements & Roadmap
To transition this project into a professional commercial product, the following updates are planned:

🔒 Security & Data Privacy
Compliance: Add a "Personal Data Processing Consent" checkbox to all forms (Appointment, Login, Registration).

Authentication: Implement full user registration and login flows.

Access Control: Restrict "Favorites" functionality to authorized users only.

📈 Functionality & UI/UX
Redux Integration: I plan to migrate the application state to Redux Toolkit to handle complex logic, such as user authentication and persistent "Favorites" storage

Pagination: Implement pagination for the Favorites page to handle large datasets efficiently.

Enhanced Calendar: Integrate react-datepicker to provide a better UI and "gray out" fully booked dates.

📝 Note for Reviewers
Current Favorites Access: For demonstration purposes, the "Favorites" page is currently accessible without authorization. This allows for immediate testing of the "add-to-favorites" logic. In the production release, this will be a protected route.

Professional Readiness: The architecture is designed to be easily extendable for real-world commercial use
