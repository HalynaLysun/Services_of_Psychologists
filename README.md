## 🚀 Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Calendar Experience**: I plan to replace the standard HTML date input with a custom library like `react-datepicker`. This will allow "disabling" (graying out) fully booked dates directly in the calendar, preventing users from selecting days with no available slots.
- **Advanced UI/UX**: Further polishing of the booking flow, including smoother transitions and real-time availability indicators.

_Note: These improvements are planned for future releases, especially if the project is transitioned into professional or commercial use._
